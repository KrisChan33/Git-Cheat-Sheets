# Quick Setup

If you've done this kind of thing before, you can quickly set up the G-Brush repository by following these steps:

1. Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

2. **Create a new repository on the command line:**
   ```bash
   echo "# G-Brush" >> README.md
   git init
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "first commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/KrisChan33/G-Brush.git
   git push -u origin main
   
3. **Push an existing repository from the command line:**
 ```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/KrisChan33/G-Brush.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Feel free to adjust the wording or formatting to better suit your needs!
